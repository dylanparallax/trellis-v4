CSTPs Addressed: CSTP 2 (Classroom Environment), CSTP 3 (Instructional Planning), CSTP 5 (Assessment)

Pre-Observation Context
Ted shared that the lesson was part of a month-long unit on cooperative games. The posted objective was:

""I can demonstrate teamwork, strategy, and encouragement through cooperative games.""

He emphasized a focus on sportsmanship, adaptability, and leadership rotation. Students had been working in teams throughout the week, with daily shoutouts and reflection prompts to build culture.

Observation Notes
Environment & Engagement (CSTP 2):

Students entered the gym to upbeat music and an enthusiastic greeting from Ted.

The space was set up with clear activity zones, color-coded cones, and visible team signs.

Ted used humor, student nicknames, and phrases like “Let’s root for each other out there” to reinforce the tone.

Every student was participating—several with visible excitement or encouraging peers.

Instructional Planning & Delivery (CSTP 3):

After a dynamic stretching warm-up, students transitioned to a game called Mission Impossible, a team-based obstacle course requiring physical agility and group coordination.

Ted gave verbal directions and modeled expected behaviors (e.g., teamwork, verbal cueing), but objectives were not posted visually.

He paused action periodically to highlight effective strategy use (“Did anyone notice how Team 3 used a communicator to guide the rope crawl?”).

Ted circulated actively and provided real-time encouragement, but skill-specific feedback (e.g., body positioning, pacing) was limited.

Assessment & Feedback (CSTP 5):

Students completed a brief debrief at the end of the period: one teammate nominated someone who showed leadership, another gave a “team shoutout.”

No written reflection or rubric was used; progress tracking appeared to be anecdotal.

Ted reinforced participation and growth mindset but did not document outcomes or provide tiered feedback.

Strengths Observed
Classroom culture is joyful, safe, and collaborative. Ted has built strong rapport with all students.

Students are active and visibly engaged in physical learning.

Emotional safety and team encouragement are a clear priority in lesson structure.

Areas for Growth
Consider using anchor visuals (team goals, cues, SEL reflection prompts) to help students track growth over time.

Explore ways to embed formative assessment, even simple rubrics or checklists, to elevate clarity and feedback.

Incorporate more direct instruction or modeling of skill-based movement strategies, particularly for students who need more support.
