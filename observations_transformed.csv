CSTP Focus: 1, 4, 5

Pre-Observation:
Tobias described the lesson as “a crescendo of spirit and rehearsal,” where students would revise, block, and rehearse their final scenes in preparation for the Winter Showcase.

Observation Notes
Opening (11:00–11:10 AM)

Students entered to dramatic orchestral music playing softly

Tobias rallied the class: “Today we don’t act—we become!”

Clear goals projected: “Polish delivery, refine movement, enhance emotional commitment”

Students split into scene groups with printed scripts, blocking diagrams, and props

Workshop Rehearsal (11:10–11:35 AM)

Group 1 worked on a dramatic breakup scene; Tobias paused to ask, “What’s your objective in this moment?”

Group 2 rehearsed a slapstick piece; Tobias demoed a pratfall, landing softly on a mat (“Years of theater... and one year of Blue Man Group tryouts.”)

Students visibly invested, asking questions about projection and emotional tone

A few technical glitches with lighting/sound cue timing—Tobias made light of it but didn’t troubleshoot

Reflection & Wrap-Up (11:35–11:45 AM)

Each group performed a 60-second excerpt

Peer applause followed by feedback in “roses and thorns” format

Tobias reminded students of the showcase and encouraged: “Let this be your opening night energy!”

Students exited with high spirits

Strengths
Students actively engaged in high-level creative tasks

Clear effort to push students emotionally and artistically

Warm, affirming environment for risk-taking

Areas for Growth
Increase clarity in modeling specific acting techniques

,Unknown Teacher,2025-01-22,formal,,[],"Focus: Teamwork Through Cooperative Games
CSTPs Addressed: CSTP 2 (Classroom Environment), CSTP 3 (Instructional Planning), CSTP 5 (Assessment)

Pre-Observation Context
Ted shared that the lesson was part of a month-long unit on cooperative games. The posted objective was:

""I can demonstrate teamwork, strategy, and encouragement through cooperative games.""

He emphasized a focus on sportsmanship, adaptability, and leadership rotation. Students had been working in teams throughout the week, with daily shoutouts and reflection prompts to build culture.

Observation Notes
Environment & Engagement (CSTP 2):

Students entered the gym to upbeat music and an enthusiastic greeting from Ted.

The space was set up with clear activity zones, color-coded cones, and visible team signs.

Ted used humor, student nicknames, and phrases like “Let’s root for each other out there” to reinforce the tone.

Every student was participating—several with visible excitement or encouraging peers.

Instructional Planning & Delivery (CSTP 3):

After a dynamic stretching warm-up, students transitioned to a game called Mission Impossible, a team-based obstacle course requiring physical agility and group coordination.

Ted gave verbal directions and modeled expected behaviors (e.g., teamwork, verbal cueing), but objectives were not posted visually.

He paused action periodically to highlight effective strategy use (“Did anyone notice how Team 3 used a communicator to guide the rope crawl?”).

Ted circulated actively and provided real-time encouragement, but skill-specific feedback (e.g., body positioning, pacing) was limited.

Assessment & Feedback (CSTP 5):

Students completed a brief debrief at the end of the period: one teammate nominated someone who showed leadership, another gave a “team shoutout.”

No written reflection or rubric was used; progress tracking appeared to be anecdotal.

Ted reinforced participation and growth mindset but did not document outcomes or provide tiered feedback.

Strengths Observed
Classroom culture is joyful, safe, and collaborative. Ted has built strong rapport with all students.

Students are active and visibly engaged in physical learning.

Emotional safety and team encouragement are a clear priority in lesson structure.

Areas for Growth
Consider using anchor visuals (team goals, cues, SEL reflection prompts) to help students track growth over time.

Explore ways to embed formative assessment, even simple rubrics or checklists, to elevate clarity and feedback.

Incorporate more direct instruction or modeling of skill-based movement strategies, particularly for students who need more support.

CSTP Focus: 1, 3, 4

Pre-Observation:
Leslie explained students would be selecting a civic issue they care about and designing a real-world action plan (petition, awareness campaign, fundraiser, etc.). Goal: activate student voice and leadership in public service.

Observation Notes
Opening (10:00–10:10 AM)

Began with a clip from “Women in Government” PSA and brief group cheer

Reviewed the “Project Proposal Protocol” step-by-step

Students given folders with scaffolds: topic planner, stakeholder map, timeline sheet

Work Session (10:10–10:35 AM)

Students in pairs/small groups brainstorming and using flip chart paper

Leslie moved around asking clarifying questions like: “Who benefits most from this?” and “What’s your first domino?”

She paused one group to highlight their use of SMART goals

Differentiation evident: one group using Google Slides, another drawing infographics

One student off-task was gently redirected: “Your voice matters. Let’s get it in the room.”

Closure (10:35–10:45 AM)

Students added their proposed project titles to a shared “Leadership Tracker” board

Leslie closed with a quote from Ann Richards: “You can’t just wish for change. You have to work for it.”

Exit slips: “What’s one thing your group is proud of today?”

Strengths
Highly engaging launch of meaningful, student-led project

Excellent use of scaffolds to promote organization and goal-setting

Seamless redirection and affirmation of students’ voices

Sheldon shared the focus would be on graphing and describing transformations of quadratic and absolute value functions. His goal was to help students describe and predict shifts using both algebraic rules and visual models.

Observation Notes
Opening (8:00–8:10 AM)

Warm-up question on the board: “What do the graphs of y = x² and y = |x| have in common?”

Sheldon reviewed correct answers by solving aloud with precise notation

Humor included a reference to a “mathematical singularity of laziness”

Students copied notes silently, with one clarifying question asked
